This is the documentation for Eos. Eos is a dynamically typed language, meaning there is no static type checking. This property allows for greater ease of use, but it has a runtime penalty, since the virtual machine ([[VM]]) has to figure out what types the are currently being utilised.

The documentation is divided in section, each section covering a module.
- The [[Chunk]] is responsible for containing the Instruction Set
-
